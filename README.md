Quarto is an impartial two-player board game invented by Swiss mathematician, Blaise Muller. The objective of the game is to get 4 pieces in a row on a 4x4 board using a combination of 16 unique pieces. Each piece is either: 

- small or large 
- red or blue
- solid or stripe
- square or circle
  
A player wins by connecting 4 pieces with the same attribute. Players take turns selecting a piece for each other from the common  pieces bank.

## Getting Started 
The game starts by player 1 choosing a piece for player 2. Player 2 then lays the first piece on the board and the game is in play.
